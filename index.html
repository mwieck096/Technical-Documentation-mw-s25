      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is an open-world western action-adventure game by <br> Rockstar Games in 2018 (Also known as the game that made me cry). Set in <br> 1899, it follows the story of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang in the <br> twilight years of the age of the outlaw. The game features an extensive and <br> detailed open world. Players interact with the world through a mix of <br> exploration, combat, and choice-driven dialogue. This documentation serves to breakdown integral gameplay mechanics.</p>

      <h2>Character Interactions</h2>
      <p>Arthur Morgan can walk, sprint, jump, crouch, and ride horses. The player has a wide array of controls (combat, horseback, exploration).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Greet NPCs (will result in a gain of honor)</li>
        <li>Antagonize or rob (will result in a loss of honor)</li>
        <li>Loot containers (or harvest parts from animals)</li>
        <li>Mount/Dismount horse (as well as pet or brush the horse)</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="Weapons_and_Crafting">
      <h2>Weapons and Crafting</h2>
      <p>The game includes revolvers, rifles, bows, and melee weapons (such as the lasso). Weapons must be maintained or they will degrade and lose effectiveness. <br> Crafting is done at campfires using gathered resources. Players can craft animal <br> bait, horse tonics, special ammunition, and more.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Honor_and_NPCs">
      <h2>Honor and NPCs</h2>
      <p>The honor system reflects moral choices made throughout the game. Higher honor unlocks positive outcomes (lower store prices and trust from NPCs); lower honor leads to fear and hostility (higher prices and greater consequences for crime). NPCs remember actions and react differently depending on Arthurâ€™s honor level (you are rewarded for being a good person). Dynamic AI remembers player behavior and their reputation.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Environment">
      <h2>Environment</h2>
      <p>RDR2 includes weather systems, wildlife, and time-based events. Shops close at night and certain wildlife appear only during specific times. Weather affects NPC schedules and environmental interactions. Game lighting and sound design shift based on the time of day.</p>
